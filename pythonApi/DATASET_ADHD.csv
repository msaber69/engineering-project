Then seeing all the toys confused me and I put them all on the sofa.,2,2,1,3,"Again I worked out what was closest to me so the bag on the bed was first. I tried to remember that most of the tasks involved setting the table for food to help remind me what to do.,",2,1,1,1,"I tried to think of the main overall task of leaving for work, so getting keys, putting shoes on, switching off light and calling boss. I then tried walking about to find things that could jog my memory like the glass of milk and chocolate were not things I was looking for but once I saw them I remembered.",8,1,1,2,"I could remember the clothes on the bathroom floor before and that was closest so I went there. I then tried thinking of the things I would do to clean up to remember about the vacuum, wiping surfaces and washing dishes. I remember to put the saucepan in the fridge because I thought that was a weird thing to ask so it was easier to remember.,",2,2,1,4,I grouped the things in the bathroom together and linked that the washing machine has to be switched off and the coffee machine has to be switched on. The radio and scarf were near the bathroom so I got them on the way. I kept an eye on the time immediatly so I would call on time. I remember the watering can at the end but was too late to use it.,2,1,1,2,"Grouped all the items to go in the saucepan together, carrots, tomato, potatos, water. Kept an eye on the time throughout to remember when to switch on the stove. Remembered to run the bath immediately. Almost forgot to wash hands in bathroom untill the last second.",2,1,1,4,Thought of everything related to that desk. Eyeglasses were in the first room so I made sure to get them. I forgot where things were but I knew what to get like the mug and book. Walking around and looking at parts I hadn't been to made me remember.,2,1,1,1,I tried to think about switching things off and my usual bedtime routine to remember to brush teeth. Again I thought of what was closest to me like the football going in the bathroom. When trying to think of the last thing I knew it has something to do with bringing something back to the bedroom. I remembered a book but wasn't able to take one from the bookshelf in the living room. Maybe there was another book somewhere.,3,2,1,2,"I struggled to connect things. I remembered to eat and get water but had to keep running around to find something to remember.,",8,1,1,0,"I tried to remember ""things to go into the study"" and I noticed the picture was out of place immediately before even being told to move it so that was easy and first. I remember the screwdriver because I have noticed it previously and the armchair was broken. The hardest to remember was the painting the wall because that wasn't something out of place. I have just remember I was to put on the footlamp as well but forgot to. But the man said I had completed all tasks. I also saw the bear and put it on the sofa. Maybe the man counted that instead of the lamp.",2,1,1,1,2,4,4,2,2,2,4,4,4,10,I tried to link the items like a POCKET in a JACKET wearing BOOTS going to the PALACE to meet the queen and kiss her RING. I may need to sew the pocket with a NEEDLE which could cause me to bleed if I prick myself so BLOOD. The TOWER of London links in with the palace. I also remember STREET from using boots to walk in. A HAWK makes me think of Middle Eastern royalty which links into the palace idea.,9,1,9,"I imagined giving my SISTER FLOWERS on a HILL on an ISLAND surrounded by a POOL because her TOOTH fell out and was put in the TRASH. Then I tried remembering my story of going to the PALACE before to remember the JACKET, POCKET, NEEDLE, BLOOD, HAWK, RING and TOWER. Then I thought of BOOTS needing to be washed with SOAP in the STREET. I also SWEAT. In writing this I now think JACKET might not be one of the words to remember. I might have gotten my memory story mixed up.",9,1,18,I tried looking out for words that were not included in my previous memory stories but I think they all were and I felt like some words were not included this time. Possibly not 18 words were shown to me. I took less notice of the words that I knew were part of my previous memory stories to focus more on which words I missed out.,7,1,0,2,4,I tried reciting them in my head but after 5 I lost track when trying to focus on the new ones. Then calling my mum stuck in my head because I switched tactic by trying to remember things I would do in my life but that made it harder to readjust my previous tactic of reciting.,1,2,0,0

So I started by getting dressed and closing the dresser. And I washed my face but wasn't quite sure how so I clicked around the cupboard a bit to find soap before realising I could just click the sink directly. I debted whether to turn off the oven after I heard the porrige boil almost instantly but wasn't told to turn it off so I left it on. Then I thought I was told to eat a sandwich on a table but I couldn't remember which table and I couldn't find a sandwich anywhere so I didn't eat anything :( Also I saw a teddybear and remembered to put it on the sofa.",3,1,1,2,"Again I tried to put this in context of my own self. So I started making a pizza and then realised I was hungry so ate the banana. Tried to time for 1.30 duration for pizza in the oven. I remembered I had to set the table so I was able to remember to grab the plates from the top left cupboard. I also remembered I had to put salad on the table because pizza in itself isn't good enough for my guests, gotta make it kind of healthy! I thought there was something else food related to add but I couldnt remember what. I also glanced around for a teddy bear but didn't see it. I then remembered  I had to call my friend so I did that, then I saw the candle in the licing room which reminded me that should bring it to the table. I didn't know how to light it. Then I realised I should have been monitoring the pizza so I checke the time and ran back to the kitchen and tried to turn the oven off and opened the oven door to get the pizza out.",3,2,1,1,That was stressful! I know I had to get to work and I totally lost the order of things so I just tried to do as much as I could remember and prioritised calling my boss exactly after 1 minute had passed. I am sure I forgot something. I barely remembered grabbing the keys.,0,0,0,0,and I also tried to link what he was directing me to do with what I remembered about the apartment (the messy table was bugging me!). I tried to follow the order of tasks but again it became difficult to manage.

I tried once again to take things 'logically' and do things room by room, but whilst for example the cooking of the vegetable soup was fairly easy as it was all grouped together, doing some of the other auxiliary tasks (e.g., washing hands, or moving magazine) proved to be more difficult in terms of remembering.",2,1,1,0,"This task seemed to be centred mostly around the work area so I did things mainly related to that first -- picking up glasses, taking book to the work desk, turning the lamp and computer on, etc. I have now remembered two things: the tea, which I forgot about until writing this, and the teddy bear, which is meant to go somewhere but I can't quite remember exactly where (this was mentioned in the introduction). But anyways, most of how I tried to solve the previous task was by grouping things together.",2,1,1,5,"This time, most of the tasks were related to sleep. I found doing most of them okay, especially the ones that involved doing something in the bedroom as in my head this place is associated with sleep. However, I must also say that in particular one task proved to 'throw me off the mark' a little bit -- putting the football in the bathroom. I thought that was quite a bit unrelated to the others. Also, the noise from the TV and the animation distracted me a little bit and it took me a few seconds to re-gain my bearings.",3,1,1,1,"I believe this task was centred much more around being active/sporty. Again, as I type this I only now remember that I had to use the exercise bike as well. I wonder why these things come to me only when I write it afterwards. Anyways, I tried to keep things logical again ( get running shoes, call mate, get snacks, water, etc. -- try and map it on to what I would do, essentially). However, what REALLY (and I mean, really) threw me off was the very last task which involved taking a hammer from the bathroom cabinet to the work desk. Apart from sounding like a scene out of American Psycho, I found it to be quite weird and not at all related to the other tasks -- I am perhaps sensing a pattern here. This put me off the other tasks a bit and I had a hard time remembering them, to an extent.",0,0,0,0,"Home renovation is the name of the game in this one. I found this task very easy because there weren't really any irrelevant tasks and everything was quite obviously there -- the power/hand tools (why does this man have a saw in his bathroom cabinet?), painting the walls, repairing the chair, these are all big tasks that are quite easy to spot even if one hadn't listened to the instructions.

I just had to remember the 30s mark and the bit about the scarf being in the hallway. Turning off the radio was an easy task to remember because the music reminded me. I got to what I thought was the end but then when it didn't finish I decided I'd forgotten something and remembered about the painkillers. I would remember that in real life because my head would probably be hurting.,3,2,1,1,"I remembered tasks as one word clues. So I thought - Wash, carrots, potato, water, magazie, bath, hob, tomato etc.",6,1,1,8,"I don't feel like I did solve all the tasks but in general I tried to just remember the tasks based on one word clues again. Eg. - Glasses, tea, cheese etc. There was something else I was supposed to pick up but I forgot what.",6,1,1,3,"I forgot so many things because I got thrown off by having to do illogical things such as moving the football to the bathroom for some reason? In real life I do forget things a lot, but I try and help myself as much as possible by coming up with a logical reason as to why I'm doing everything. Some of these tasks seem kind of pointless and therefore harder to remember that normal every day tasks.",0,0,0,0,"I tried to rememeber all the tasks as one word clue again. However, I think i missed a couple things this time so after I'd done all the tasks I could remember I just started looking around random draws and cupboards to see if it would help me remember additional tasks but that did not really work.",6,2,1,0,"I tried remembering tasks as one word clues again but it didn't really help fully. For example, I remembered drill and saw but spent a significant amount of time just looking around the apartment for both and found neither (except the drill which I found right as time ran out) I also couldn't find a spot to hang the painting even though i remembered to do something with the painting.",6,1,1,0,2,4,2,4,4,2,3,5,2,9,I read the words out loud as I went through the task and tried to repeat them back to myself but the next word started coming before I could commit the previous words to memory and I fell behind so lost track. ,1,1,0,"I quickly noticed that the words were the same as the previous group of words so instead I tried to focus on the words I hadn't remembered last time. I memorised those (to some degree) then after rewriting those, I tried to remember the other ones that were still in my head from the previous memory task. ",7,1,0,"Again, I tried to just focus on the words I didn't get on the previous attempts and repeated them out loud to myself. After I'd written out the ones I'd remembered from the 3rd attempt I tried to recall what words I'd filled out from the previous 2 attempts. ",7,2,0,4,2,I tried to remember the instructions as one word clues then try and associate that with further memories after recalling the word. This didn't always work though. I can't remember what I was supposed to do with the baguette - however this feels somewhat unrealistic because in real life I would know for certain as soon as I picked up the baguette what I intention I had for it. It's not so easy just reading what I'm supposed to do with the baguette within a few seconds and committing that to memory. ,6,1,0,0
